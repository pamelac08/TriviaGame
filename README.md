### Project Description:

An application for further practice using Javascript, jQuery as well as timers for logic and manipulating HTML

* This application takes the player through a coffee-themed trivia game that displays one question at a time until the player answers it or their time runs out.
* The player has 20 seconds to answer each question.  Once the player selects an answer or the timer runs out, the game will automatically move to the next question after 4 seconds
* At the end, the game will display the number of correct, incorrect, and not answered questions - with the option to restart the game



Primarily used click event listeners, conditional statements, and timers to run this application.
